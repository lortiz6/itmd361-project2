        <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
        <p>I was originally born in Mexico, and moved to the U.S when I was
          fourteen years old. Since then, I have learned to love Chicago which I
          concider my home.
        </p>
        <p>I am a full-time student, and a mother of four beautiful children, two
          of them being special needs. Is hard to be a full-time mother and
          student, but life has showed me that school is very important.
        </p>
        <p>Being back to school has given me the oportunity to prove my kids that
          is never to late to what they love, no matter how hard life gets.
