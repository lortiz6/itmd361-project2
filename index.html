      <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
      <p>I was originally born in Mexico, and moved to the U.S when I was
        fourteen years old. Since then, I have learned to love Chicago which I
        concider my home.</p>
      <p>I am a full-time student, and a mother of four beautiful children, two
        of them being special needs. Is hard to be a full-time mother and
        student, but life has showed me that school is very important.</p>
      <p>Being back to school has given me the oportunity to prove my kids that
        is never to late to what they love, no matter how hard life gets.</p>
      <h4>Some of my favorite things to do besides spending time with my family,
        and helping others are:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Make acrylic nails</li>
        <li>Swiming</li>
        <li>Listen to music, specially bachata</li>
        <li>Play basketball</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Here are some of the nails I have done:</h4>
